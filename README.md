# COVID-19 Trend Analysis

## Overview
This project aims to visualize and analyze various aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic on a global scale, focusing on country-specific cases, recovery, and mortality rates over time. It provides a comprehensive understanding of how the pandemic evolved through graphical representations of confirmed cases, recoveries, and deaths. The data is analyzed to calculate recovery and mortality rates to offer insights into the effectiveness of different countries' responses to the pandemic.

## Data Source
- [Novel Corona Virus 2019 Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sudalairajkumar/novel-corona-virus-2019-dataset) from Kaggle

## Setup
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the necessary Python packages:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
    ```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook file `covid19.ipynb` to generate the visualizations.

## Analysis
The analysis is divided into two parts:
1. **Cases Over Time**: This includes visualizations of confirmed, recovered, and death cases over time for different countries and globally.
2. **Rates Analysis**: This includes the calculation and visualization of recovery and mortality rates over time for each country and globally.

### Key Calculations
- **Recovery Rate**: \(\text{Recovered Cases} / \text{Confirmed Cases}\)
- **Mortality Rate**: \(\text{Deaths} / \text{Confirmed Cases}\)

If there are no confirmed cases on a given day, the rates are recorded as 0%.

## Visualizations
- Each country has two plots:
  1. **Cases Over Time**: Shows confirmed, recovered, and death cases.
  2. **Rates Over Time**: Displays recovery and mortality rates.

### Example Visualizations
- **Australia Cases Over Time** (`australia-cases.png`)
- **India Recovery and Mortality Rates** (`india-rates.png`)
- **Global Cases Over Time** (`world-cases.png`)
- **Global Recovery and Mortality Rates** (`world-rates.png`)

## Conclusions
- **Global Trends**: Recovery rates tend to increase over time, indicating an improvement in medical responses as the pandemic progresses, while mortality rates show a gradual decline.
- **Country-Specific Insights**: Some countries exhibit higher mortality rates initially but achieve better recovery rates later, possibly due to healthcare improvements and public health measures.
- **Effectiveness of Measures**: Countries with early containment and robust healthcare systems demonstrate a higher recovery rate and lower mortality rate.

## Future Work
- Adding more countries and regions to the analysis.
- Incorporating vaccination data to study its impact on recovery and mortality rates.
- Using machine learning models to predict future trends based on historical data.
